# nippers
Nippers the Scrivener is intended to be a workalike for the Scrivener writers' program, with compatibility with the data files (work files) generated by the commercial program. The name is from one of the scriveners in the story "Bartleby the Scrivener" â€” one of the ones who did not "prefer not to".
