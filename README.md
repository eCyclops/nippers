Nippers the Scrivener is intended to be a workalike for the Scrivener writers' program, with compatibility with the data files (work files) generated by the commercial program. The name is from one of the scriveners in the story *Bartleby the Scrivener* by Herman Melville â€” one of the ones who did not "prefer not to". I trust that he will not be too wild for use.
